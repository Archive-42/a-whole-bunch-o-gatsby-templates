# Gatsby Theme + Sanity.io from Scratch

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is used as an example to showcase [Gatsby Themes][gatsbythemes] + [Sanity.io][sanityio]. It's used by me as a live demo on talks but you can have a look at the commit history to get a glimpse of what's going on!

This simple example showcases:

- An example website for a meetup. That meetup has its information hard-coded into the React code but now would like to add a list of upcoming and previous meetups to the website. Non-technical folks should be able to edit this. The example will use Sanity.io for that. The homepage has the next upcoming event, on a separate page the whole list is displayed
- A theme that accesses Sanity and creates a list of those meetup dates. Components from it can also be used in isolation, e.g. on the homepage
- Theme UI should be used for styling

This theme won't be published to npm, it's only for testing purposes.

# BaseAnchor

A skeleton component on which styled [AnchorButton](?path=/story/core-anchorbutton) is built.

This is just a wrapper for HTML `<a />` element that makes sure that all links with `target="_blank"` have their `rel` attribute set to `"noopener noreferrer"`.

## Props

`AnchorButton` accepts all props accepted by HTML's `<a>` element.

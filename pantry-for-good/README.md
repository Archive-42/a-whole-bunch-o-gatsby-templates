This repository is for the Pantry-for-Good application designed by Open Source for Good Contributors at [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). If you'd like to contribute the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains the git workflow and the [developers guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/pantry-for-good/wiki/developer's-guide) gives an overview of how the app works. 

The [open issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/pantry-for-good/issues) are a good place to start, or you can try the app and add your own issues. If you get stuck or need help with something feel free to leave a comment.

Some issues are quite large, don't feel like you have to finish them. Little bits help too!

There's a demo app hosted at https://pantry-for-good.herokuapp.com, though it might be a bit behind the current version.

## Installation
The app is designed to be installed locally (mac, linux or windows) or on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

You can deploy it to Heroku by clicking the button. An admin account with email `admin@example.com` and password `password` will be created.

### Detailed local development installation steps

You'll need to have a **Node.js** version >= 6 installed. Either use your OS's package manager or follow the installation instructions on the [official website](http://nodejs.org).

This app uses **MongoDB** as its database engine. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition) to install it locally and start the MongoDB server on your machine.

Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if it is not already installed. To clone this repository to your local machine, open a command line interface and navigate to the directory where you would like to install the app. Then run
`git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/Pantry-for-Good.git`

Move to the `Pantry-for-Good` directory and run the `npm install` command to install the application dependencies.

Type `npm run dev` to start the application in development mode. If all goes well, it will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.  The application is pre-populated with an administrator account with username `admin@example.com` and password `password`.

### Installing API keys

To use all the features of this application you will need to obtain API keys and install them in the application. Make a copy of the `server/config/env/secrets-template.js` file in the same directory and rename it `secrets.js`.  After following the instructions below to obtain API Keys, put your keys in this file.

#### 1. [gmapsApiKey](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
Google Maps API key required for the deliveries feature
#### 2. [oauth](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project)
Google+ API for allowing users to register/login with google.
#### 3. [sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com)
Sendgrid email API for sending emails.
- Register for a trial account or deploy the app and get the username/password from the heroku config vars
- Go to [Settings > API Keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) and create a key
- Paste the key in `secrets.js` or the `SENDGRID_API_KEY` config var of your deployed app.

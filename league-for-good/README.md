- Run `npm install`
- In the root directory, create a .env file and place the following: 
  - MONGO_URI = *Your database uri* 
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = *Client id assigned by Google* 
  - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = *Client secret assigned by Google*
  - SESSION_SECRET = *Any random string of characters*
  - GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL = http://localhost:4000/auth/google/callback (*Use for the callback url in the Google API console*)
- Open a new terminal session and run `mongod` if mongodb is on the local machine
- Run `npm run dev`
- Navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser

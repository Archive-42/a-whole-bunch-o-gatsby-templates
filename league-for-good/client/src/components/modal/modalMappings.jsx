/* Map all the components and/or props to be used
		inside the main modal component
	Required:
		title -    (STRING) The modals title prop
		Children - (function/null) Components to be rendered inside the modal
		onSubmit - (STRING) The name of the action that will be dispatched

	ex-

		const LeagueForm = props => (
			<form> .... </form>
		);

		const mappings = {
			EditLeague: {
				title: 'Edit League',
				childen: LeagueForm(),
				onSubmit: 'submitLeagueEdits'
			}
		};

		Pretend that a button was clicked that triggered the action:
			openModal('EditLeague')
			(see the ../nav/menu for an example of how this is
			used to trigger the Log Out modal)
		Now this.props.modal will be set to: {open: true, view: 'EditLeague'}

		The modal component will update itself by calling:
		  mappings[this.props.modal.view] (see the main.jsx file)

*************
	Note: The Children key in the object must be capitalized for the modal to
		   render correctly with Material UI

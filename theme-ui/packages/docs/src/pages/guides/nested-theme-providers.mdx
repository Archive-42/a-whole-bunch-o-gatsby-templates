# Nested Theme Providers

While in most cases, you'll be using a `ThemeProvider` component at the root of your application to set a site-wide theme,
nested Theme Providers are a powerful way to adjust styles contextually.

For example, when building a Gatsby theme, you may want to set some base thematic values
that the user can easily override to match their site,
but keep some theme-specific styles for use only in the pages that your Gatsby theme generates.
Or, you might want to have a global theme, but adjust styles in a small section of a page to render with a dark color scheme.

## How contexts merge

When adding a nested Theme Provider, it will inherit the `theme` and `components` object from its parent.
The `theme` object will be deeply merged with the outer context's theme.
The `components` object will override any outer context components, but apply styling based on `theme.styles`.
The inner Theme Provider will not create a new color mode state, but inherit this from the parent.

## Gatsby themes

When building a Gatsby theme, you should use [`gatsby-plugin-theme-ui`](/gatsby-plugin) for parts of your theme that should be overridden or merged with other themes.
If you need to specify a Gatsby theme-specific subtheme, use a nested Theme Provider in a layout component that only renders around pages that you control.
This allows the end user to change their site-level theme without affecting custom styles you might need in your theme.
The end user can still shadow any components in your theme if they need to.

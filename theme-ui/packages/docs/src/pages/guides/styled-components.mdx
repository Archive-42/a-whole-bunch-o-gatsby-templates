# Styled Components

If you're already using the `styled` API from the [@emotion/styled][] package, those components should have access to the same theming context that Theme UI uses.
Instead of using the `ThemeProvider` component from `emotion-theming`, you can import and use the Theme UI provider.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import theme from './theme'
import SomeComponent from './SomeComponent'

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <SomeComponent />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

If you're using the [Styled Components][] library, we're looking into integrations for existing components, but these can usually be converted to use Emotion with a single line change to the `import` statement.

```js
// before
import styled from 'styled-components'
```

```js
// after
import styled from '@emotion/styled'
```

## Using the `sx` prop

To avoid the need for an additional dependency,
you can use the `sx` prop to create custom styled components.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'

export default ({ width, color, bg, ...props }) => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      width,
      color,
      bg,
      // additional styles...
    }}
  />
)
```

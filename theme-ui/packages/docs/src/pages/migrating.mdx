# Migration Guides

## v0.2

### JSX Pragma

If you were using the Theme UI custom JSX pragma, rename the `css` prop to `sx`. This does not apply if you were importing and using the `css` utility function manually.

### `theme-ui-typography`

If you were using the `theme-ui-typography` package, install the new package named `@theme-ui/typography` instead.
The `toStyle` API is no longer included. Use the `toTheme` API instead, see the [Typography.js docs](/styling-mdx/#typographyjs) for how to use this utility.

### `Box` and layout component

If you were using Styled System style props on the `Box` component or any other layout component, replace these props with either the [`sx` prop](/sx-prop) or by using the `css` utility.

### Other

- Replace `ColorModeProvider` and `ComponentProvider` with the `ThemeProvider` component.
- The `@emotion/styled` package is no longer required for Theme UI. If you are not using it directly in your application, you can remove it from your dependencies.

# Static CSS

Certain projects have constraints that require using static CSS rather
than CSS-in-JS. Theme UI contains (experimental) libraries to transform
a theme config to the proper format for other CSS libraries.

This allows you to use the Theme UI implementation in React-based projects
and share the same theme or design tokens in your design system with other projects so you
can incrementally adopt Theme UI.

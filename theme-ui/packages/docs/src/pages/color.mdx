# Color

Color abstractions are _extremely_ hard to get right and, by nature, very specific to a particular design.
The proposal here is mostly meant as a starting point, but deviation from this is to be expected.

## Core Colors

These color names are meant to be generic and as widely applicable as possible.

- `text`
- `background`
- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `muted`
- `highlight`

## Component Colors

At a lower-level, component-specific colors could map core colors to specific elements.
This could also be handled with or remapped to `theme.styles` at an even lower-level.

The following is a list of examples, and not necessarily required for all themes.

```
colors: {
  heading: 'text',
  pre: {
    text: 'secondary',
    background: 'muted',
  },
  header: {
    // e.g. reversed color scheme
    text: 'background',
    background: 'primary',
  },
  footer: {
    text: 'text',
    background: 'muted',
  },
}
```

# Components

<Note>This is a proposal and not implemented yet</Note>

Other components that _could be_ included in this library:

- `Button`
- `NavLink`
- `Avatar`
- `Label`
- `Input`
- `Select`
- `Badge`
- `Card`
- `Alert/Note/Message`
- `Breadcrumb`
- `Icon` - icons could open up a can of worms, but having a few good defaults in a limited set would be nice to have

title: Getting started with Gatsby
---

Create a new site:

```shell
npm init gatsby
```

Follow the prompts to choose your preferred CMS, styling tools and additional features.

Once everything is downloaded you will see a message with instructions for navigating to your site and running it locally.

```shell
Start by going to the directory with

cd gatsby-site

Start the local development server with

npm run develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `http://localhost:8000`.

Now you're ready to make changes to your site!

Try editing the home page in `src/pages/index.js`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

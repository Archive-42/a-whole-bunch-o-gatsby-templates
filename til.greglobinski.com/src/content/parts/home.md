Hi, I'm Greg, welcome to my TIL notebook. I launched this site, inspired by [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1009174159690264579), to note down some of the small pieces of knowledge I learn on a daily basis.

It is an experiment. I want to believe that things noted down here will stay in my memory for longer. It is to early to say it works but we will see.

You will not find here extensive analytic articles. Rather expect short unsorted notes related to front-end development.

If you want to be in touch and be informed about new notes follow me on Twitter Â» [@greglobinski](https://twitter.com/greglobinski)

Powers the creation of GraphQL interfaces and sourcing of files. Sets the instances of `gatsby-source-filesystem`, `gatsby-transformer-yaml`, `gatsby-source-graphql`, and `gatsby-plugin-mdx` among other things. Adds custom resolvers and uses the schema customization API to modify the GraphQL layer.

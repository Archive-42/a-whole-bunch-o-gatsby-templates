# Generated Data

Normally you wouldn't track generated data in git; however we deliberately
keep these resources under version control:

- `schema.graphql` is compared during upgrades, migrations and pull requests
  so you can see what has changed and ensure thereâ€™s no accidental GraphQL
  regressions
- `schema.sql` is kept for similar (but database) reasons, and to
  help you to ensure that all developers are running the same version of the
  database without accidental differences caused by faulty migration hygeine

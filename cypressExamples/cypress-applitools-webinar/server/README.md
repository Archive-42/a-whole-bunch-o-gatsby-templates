# cypress-applitools-webinar

Companion Code to "Functional and Visual Testing with Cypress.io and Applitools" webinar

## Getting started

1. First, you install the npm dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```

   This will `npm ci` both the backend and the frontend

1. Then, build the code:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

  This is not formally needed for running in dev, as it builds the production build for the frontend

1. Last, start the frontend and backend server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

1. To see the application, goto http://localhost:4100

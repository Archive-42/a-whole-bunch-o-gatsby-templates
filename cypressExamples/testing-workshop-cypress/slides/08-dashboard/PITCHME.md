### üìö You will learn

- Purpose for Cypress Dashboard
- How to send test results to Cypress Dashboard

  - no consistent view of the tests

+++

## Cypress dashboard

## Bonus

- make a test to fail on purpose
- look at the test failure on the dashboard

+++

## Big bonus: Parallelization

- run tests on N machines in 1/N time with [https://on.cypress.io/parallelization](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization)

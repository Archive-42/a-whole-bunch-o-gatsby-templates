title: How the Gatsby core team labels issues
---

## What are issue labels?

Issue labels are a tool in GitHub that are used to group issues into one or more categories.

[Check out Gatsby's labels (and their descriptions)](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels)

## Why label issues?

Gatsby is a very active project with many new issues opened each day. Labeling issues helps by identifying:

- good issues for new contributors to work on
- reported and confirmed bugs
- feature requests
- duplicate issues
- issues that are stalled or blocked
- the status of an open issue
- the topic or subject matter of the issue

## Who can label issues?

Anyone who's a member of the [Gatsby Maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/gatsbyjs/teams/maintainers) can label issues. At this time, that's composed of Gatsby core team members who participate in first touch maintenance.

## How we label an issue

When a new issue is filed, our Gatsbot applies a `status: triage needed` label to it. Triage is undertaken every workday by Gatsby Core Team members.

Triaging new issues involves identifying each issue's type (such as feature request or bug report), topic (such as GraphQL or Gatsby Recipes), and status. These labels are then part of a broader issue management workflow undertaken by the rest of the Gatsby team.

The general steps to triaging an issue are:

- Read an issue
- Choose the labels that apply to that issue
- Include any helpful comments that guide the author toward the next steps they need to take
- That's it - sit back and relax, maybe take a few moments to enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done

For a full list of labels, see [Gatsby's issue labels and their descriptions](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/labels), particularly the `type:`, `topic:`, and `status:` labels.

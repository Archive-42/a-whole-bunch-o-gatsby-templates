title: Quick Start
---

This quick start is intended for intermediate to advanced developers. For a gentler intro to Gatsby, [head to our tutorial](/docs/tutorial/)!

## Getting started with Gatsby

1. Create a new site

```shell
npm init gatsby
```

Follow the prompts to choose your preferred CMS, styling tools and additional features.

2. Once everything is downloaded you will see a message with instructions for navigating to your site and running it locally.

It will look like this, but use your project's directory.

Start by going to the directory with

```shell
cd my-gatsby-site
```

Start the local development server with

```shell
npm run develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. Now you're ready to make changes to your site!

Try editing the home page in `src/pages/index.js`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

## What's next?

### Add more features

[Install and configure additional plugins](/docs/recipes/) to quickly add additional functionality to your site.

### Deploy your site

Try using [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/cloud/) to build and deploy your site to one of many hosting providers.

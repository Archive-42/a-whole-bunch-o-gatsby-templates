  Gatsby Functions Google Sheets Example
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Get Google Authentication Token.**

    This sample uses the Google Service account to authenticate into Google Spreadsheet API. To receive the proper token information, you'll need to set up an account in the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

    - Set up your project in the Google API console. You can follow the instructions highlighted in Google Account Authentication tutorial [here](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-sreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication)
    - Generate a service account and download the access token. You can follow the steps highlighted in [Account Authentication - Service Account](https://theoephraim.github.io/node-google-spreadsheet/#/getting-started/authentication?id=service-account)
    - Create an `.env.development` file. Copy into it from the downloaded JSON key file:

    ```
    GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=copy service account email
    GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=copy private key
    ```

2.  **Create a Test Spreadsheet.**

    - Generate a new spreadsheet via [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets)
    - Grant owner access to the spreadsheet to your service account email address.
    - You will need the Sheet ID to properly run the example. Sheet ID can be found in the URL of a Google spreadsheet. For example, you can find it via `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<GOOGLE_SHEET_ID>/`. Add this to your `.env.development` file as well.

3.  **Start developing.**

    To get started, run `npm install` to add all necessary packages.

    When developing locally, you'll want to include the ENV variables in your `.env.development`. Read more about how Gatsby handles `.env` files and environment variables in the [Gatsby Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/)

    ```shell
    cd examples/functions-google-sheets
    npm install
    npm run develop
    ```

4.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000! You can use the UI on the index page to test the functions or directly access them at http://localhost:8000/api/sheets

    Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!

5.  **Deploy**

You can deploy this example on Gatsby Cloud by copying the example into a new repo and [connecting that to Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/#set-up-an-existing-gatsby-site).

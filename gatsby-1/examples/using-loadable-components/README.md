# Gatsby + loadable-components

This repo is meant to illustrate the pattern of adding [loadable-components](https://loadable-components.com/docs/getting-started/) to a Gatsby project. In this case, the Header component is being code-split out while maintaining SSR.

```jsx
// src/components/layout.jsx
import * as React from "react"

const Header = loadable(() => import("./header"))
export default Header
```

## Why?

Why do you need to do this when Gatsby already has excellent out-of-the-box code-splitting configuration?

There is one main scenario: _conditional rendering_. This can come in two forms:

- flex layouts from CMS content
- logic in a component that may or may not render an import

These are essentially the same thing, but at different scales.

### Flex Layouts

When you build a page with a headless CMS, parts of your site may have a structured layout that is defined in code by components and can only be changed with a code change. Other pages, due to business cases or user preferences, need to have flexible layouts where a content editor can mix and reorder components in the CMS, and have that layout reflected in the code.

The most common pattern is a switch case or series of if statements checking the componentâ€™s type, rendering the correct one and passing in its props.

```jsx
// src/components/flex-page.jsx
import * as React from "react"

const FlexPage = ({ components }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {components.map(component => {
        switch (component.type) {
          case "header":
            return <Header {...component} />
          case "text":
            return <Text {...component} />
          case "carousel":
            return <Carousel {...component} />
          default:
            return <div>empty</div>
        }
      })}
    </>
  )
}

export default FlexPage
```

### Logical Checks in Render

This is basically the above pattern but on a smaller scale.

```jsx
import * as React from "react"

const FlexPage = ({ hasCarousel }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Heading />
      <Text />
      {hasCarousel && <Carousel />}
    </div>
  )
}

export default FlexPage
```

### The Conditional Drawback

So whatâ€™s the problem with the patterns above? A content editor can build a page with a Heading, Text or a Carousel. Technically, the page will display as expected, but imagine a page where the editor only choose a Heading and Text. In that case, the Carousel and its dependencies will still be on the page!

This is because Gatsbyâ€™s default code splitting configuration we mentioned at the beginning splits bundles by page-level. That means any import in a page template will end up in its bundle whether it is actually rendered, used, or not.

## How to Configure

To use loadable-components with SSR, we use a Gatsby plugin, [gatsby-plugin-loadable-components-ssr](https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-loadable-components-ssr). This makes the webpack configuration we need to use loadable-components while _maintaining SSR_. This is crucial, because if you only code-split, yes the bundle can be smaller, but the client-side rendering will drastically hurt performance more than the bundle reduction could make up. To configure the plugin, follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/graysonhicks/gatsby-plugin-loadable-components-ssr).

## Verification

Once you follow this pattern, how can you test if a component is being code-split and SSR'd? The easiest way is through DevTools.

After building the site and serving locally, refresh the page with DevTools open.

First, verify the code-splitting by looking for a JS bundle in the Network tab with the naming pattern: `component--[my-component]-[hash].js`.

Then, to verify SSR is still working, click the 'All' option in the Network tab and look for the first item `localhost`. This is the initial HTML sent by Gatsby. Verify that you can see the code-split component in this initial HTML.

That's it, happy building! ðŸŽ‰

# File System Route API

This example showcases the APIs and conventions for using the file system as the primary way of creating pages. You should be able to accomplish most common tasks with this file-based API. If you want more control over the page creation you should use the [`createPages`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis#createPages) API.

In short, these APIs enable you to programmatically create pages from Gatsby's [GraphQL data layer](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/graphql-concepts/) and to create [client-only routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/client-only-routes-and-user-authentication).

You can learn more in the [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/file-system-route-api/).

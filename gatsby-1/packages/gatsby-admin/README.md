# Gatsby Admin

A visual interface to configure your Gatsby site. Currently alpha testing.

## Getting started

For now, Gatsby Admin is marked as experimental and requires a flag to enable. Add the following flag when using `gatsby develop`:

```shell
GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ADMIN=true gatsby develop
```

Or in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "develop": "GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ADMIN=true gatsby develop"
}
```

**Note**: If youâ€™re on Windows you should install [`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) and prepend your script, e.g.:

```json
{
  "develop": "cross-env GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ADMIN=true gatsby develop"
}
```

Once you run `gatsby develop` with the flag enabled, you can visit `http://localhost:8000/___admin` to view Admin for your Gatsby site!

When you select an installed plugin or search for a new one, you will be able to install/uninstall/configure it:

Let us know what you think by hitting the "Send feedback" button in Admin or commenting in [the Admin umbrella issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/27402)!

## Troubleshooting

Admin does not support all `gatsby-config.js` formats. If yours is not supported, we'd love if you could share what it looks like in the [umbrella issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/27402)!

## Technical documentation

### Architecture

The Gatsby Admin interface (this package) is a standard Gatsby site.

It uses [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com) (with the [strict-ui](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/pull/719) experimental extension) and [gatsby-interface](https://github.com/gatsby-inc/gatsby-interface) for styling.

It fetches its data from the [gatsby-recipes GraphQL server](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/src/graphql-server), which exposes all the information Admin needs about the locally running Gatsby site, using [urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql).

It also listens to the [`gatsby develop` status server](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/commands/develop.ts), which exposes information about whether you changed the config files and need to restart the develop process.

#### Service Discovery

`gatsby develop` automatically starts both the GraphQL and status server. However, both of these use random ports.

To discover where they are (and whether they are already running) there is a service discovery mechanism in `gatsby-core-utils`. It stores the ports of the running Gatsby site(s) at `~/.config/gatsby/sites/<pathhash>/<servername>.json`.

Admin can then fetch `http://localhost:8000/___services` (where `:8000` is the well-known port of the running site), which returns a list of all the random ports used by the site:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8000/___services | jq
{
  "developproxy": {
    "port": 8000
  },
  "developstatusserver": {
    "port": 60731
  },
  "recipesgraphqlserver": {
    "port": 50400
  }
}
```

That's how the Admin frontend knows to connect to `http://localhost:50400/graphql` to connect to the GraphQL server, and `http://localhost:60731` to connect to the develop status server.

#### Production Deployment

To avoid clashing with the local site and potential issues with shadowing, `gatsby develop` statically serves the built files from the [develop parent proxy](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/develop-proxy.ts).

To avoid issues with yarn, lerna, and circular dependencies, `gatsby-admin` copies its built files to `gatsby/gatsby-admin-public` which is then published to npm. While not an ideal solution, it fixes the issue and works relatively reliably.

### Development

#### Running it locally

The easiest way to work on Admin locally is to develop Admin itself.

1. Make sure to have the dependencies installed by running `yarn` in the root folder
2. Start the develop process for the Admin site by running `yarn workspace gatsby-admin run develop`

> If you see eslint errors you'll need to temporarily replace all references to `___loader` with `window.___loader` in `packages/gatsby-link/index.js`.

#### Running it on a local site

To try Admin with one of your sites locally, use the `gatsby-dev-cli` to copy the local versions of `gatsby`, `gatsby-cli`, `gatsby-recipes`, `gatsby-core-utils` and `gatsby-admin` into your project:

```shell
# Make sure to build the latest local versions of all packages
~/gatsby
yarn run watch

~/my-gatsby-site
$ gatsby-dev --packages gatsby gatsby-cli gatsby-recipes gatsby-core-utils gatsby-admin

# In another tab, start your site with the Admin feature flag set
~/my-gatsby-site
$ GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ADMIN=true gatsby develop
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_admin` and you should see Gatsby Admin for your site!

**Gatsby Starter Kit** is a set of starters for [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) **v2**, created and maintained by [@greglobinski](https://twitter.com/greglobinski). Follow [me](https://twitter.com/greglobinski) if you want to be informed about updates.

There are **five** default starters:

- Minimal
- Equipped
- Themed
- Website
- Blog

Every of the default starters are built on top of the previous one with additional features.

The starters are maintain as separate branches of the same [git repository](https://github.com/greglobinski/gatsby-starter-kit).

:two: :soon: Please remember, the **Kit** works with Gatsby **version 2** which is in **beta** now. It seems the release will be soon, but still. I decided to built the **Gatsby Starter Kit** for future advisedly.

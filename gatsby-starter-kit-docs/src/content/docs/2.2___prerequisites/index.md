To install any of the **Kit**'s starter you need [Gatsby&nbsp;CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) installed globally on your computer. If you do not have it yet, install it now.

```
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

### Gatsby newcomers

If you are completely new to Gatsby, I strongly recommend to work through the official [tutorial](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/), there is no better place to start.

### Windows users

Some of Gatsby plugins, e.g. **gatsby-plugin-sharp**, require building native Node.js modules. So, you need a functional build environment (Python and Visual C++ Build Tools) on your computer. Without proper build environment you will not be able to install any of the Kit's starter. Read&nbsp;[more](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/).
